## About

This is an implementation of the classic arcade game with a focus on a smooth, elegant UX.

## Features

- Borders do not show up until the snake gets close.
- Personal high score stored in a cookie.
- A "direction change array" in the background that allows users to input direction changes in quick succession. This is useful for moving along the edges of the board.
- Intro animations for the beginning and end of the game.
